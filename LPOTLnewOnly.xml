    <updated>2021-06-25T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content>This week, we continue our four-part series on the Black Death. In Part Three, we take a closer look at the Catholic Church's system of selling indulgences; we learn how one horny pope moved the papacy to Avignon; we examine the virulent antisemitism that engulfed so much of plague-stricken Europe; and we recount the tale of the curse of Grand Master de Molay.

    <content>On part two, we explore the ways in which war, superstition, and fear gripped Europe as the plague robbed the continent of human life. Then, we travel north through Italy to get a closer look at the disease as it moved like a piranha, spilling blood in the gutters of Messina, Florence, Venice, and beyond.
What does God's divine retribution look like? How far can rats jump? And what is the most elegant way to ditch your sickly family member? All answers will be revealed.
