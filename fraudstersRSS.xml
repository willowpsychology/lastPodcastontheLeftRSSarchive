    <content>In part I of Fraud Reich we brought you historical fiction—the story of the Hitler Diaries. Today we bring you a sci-fi thriller featuring Adolph Hitler, Hans Loads, David Bowie, and a fraudster named Trevor Ravenscroft.

    <title>Episode 12: Fraud Reich Part I – Hitler Fan Fiction (that everyone believed)</title>
    <updated>2020-11-12T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content>Dear Diary, Many historically significant figures generate lore. Some say Shakespeare didn't write his plays. Some say Nikola Tesla designed blueprints for a "death ray" before his passing. Some say Thomas Jefferson drank breast milk! Few theories, however, are as wild and as widely entertained as the Hitler Diaries were. On the 12th episode of Fraudsters Season 1, we talk where the myth began and how it snowballed into 62 forged Hitler diaries lauded as true by some of the foremost historians and news outlets in Europe. So excited to share this episode with all the Spotifites out there. Love, Seena, Justin, Hazel, and Marie PS: I made up the breast milk myth</content>

    <content>Our final episode of the mini-series we walk you through justice finally being served in the case of Jim Bakker: How he went to prison for 25 years and came out as a reformed man who lived a quiet, secular life back in Michigan. / Just kidding! He barely went to prison and wasn't humbled by it at all. / On this final episode we spend more time talking about an incarcerated Jim Bakker than he spent in prison. We get into his prison hustles, his strange choice of friends, his post-release shenanigans and reflect on the series as a whole.</content>

    <updated>2020-09-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content>In part 2 of our mini-series on Jacob Wohl, we pivot to his political frauds–covering his ploys to defame Dr. Fauci, Elizabeth Warren, and even Mayor Pete. While just as ludicrous as his earlier financial crimes, his political schemes seem to lack conviction–both in the sense that he no longer seems invested in sustaining charades longer than it takes to create chaos and / because he isn't held responsible for them. / Special thanks to Nancy Rommelmann for a delightful interview.</content>

    <content>What did you do as a teenager–jump rope? AIM your crush? Listen to Green Day on your cool new iPod classic? Going out on a limb, but we bet you weren't engaging in elaborate schemes to defraud people of their life savings! Just a guess. Our latest mini-series features Jacob Wohl–a Gen Z scammer who's gone through fraudulent business ventures faster than a normal teen goes through acne cream. On this episode we look at his financial frauds from deceptive hedgefunds to real–FAKE–estate companies, break down the bizarre business practices with an actual finance expert, and sing. Yes... we sing. All that and more on this episode of FRAUDDDSSSTTTERSS. / Special thanks to: Simon TaufiQue for composing the amazing new theme music for Fraudsters.
