    <content>We all remember the day Rachel Dolezal broke the internet in 2015, but at this point is it even surprising when we hear about a white lady pretending to be Black or Puerto Rican or Spanish? What drives a person to lie about something as fundamental as their racial or cultural identity? Today we're dissecting the appropriations and the non-apologies from Dolezal to Hilary "I vacationed once in Spain so I am Spanish" Baldwin - all for your listening pleasure. / Huge thanks to all the wonderful guests who joined us for this episode!! / Elena Romero - fashion, hip hop, and Latinx journalist. / Elisa Prosperetti - visiting professor of history at Mount Holyoke College. / Lauren Michele Jackson - author of White Negroes.

    <content>Dear Diary, Many historically significant figures generate lore. Some say Shakespeare didn't write his plays. Some say Nikola Tesla designed blueprints for a "death ray" before his passing. Some say Thomas Jefferson drank breast milk! Few theories, however, are as wild and as widely entertained as the Hitler Diaries were. On the 12th episode of Fraudsters Season 1, we talk where the myth began and how it snowballed into 62 forged Hitler diaries lauded as true by some of the foremost historians and news outlets in Europe. So excited to share this episode with all the Spotifites out there. Love, Seena, Justin, Hazel, and Marie PS: I made up the breast milk myth</content>

    <content>Our final episode of the mini-series we walk you through justice finally being served in the case of Jim Bakker: How he went to prison for 25 years and came out as a reformed man who lived a quiet, secular life back in Michigan. / Just kidding! He barely went to prison and wasn't humbled by it at all. / On this final episode we spend more time talking about an incarcerated Jim Bakker than he spent in prison. We get into his prison hustles, his strange choice of friends, his post-release shenanigans and reflect on the series as a whole.</content>

    <updated>2020-09-24T00:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <content>In part 2 of our mini-series on Jacob Wohl, we pivot to his political frauds‚Äìcovering his ploys to defame Dr. Fauci, Elizabeth Warren, and even Mayor Pete. While just as ludicrous as his earlier financial crimes, his political schemes seem to lack conviction‚Äìboth in the sense that he no longer seems invested in sustaining charades longer than it takes to create chaos and / because he isn't held responsible for them. / Special thanks to Nancy Rommelmann for a delightful interview.</content>
